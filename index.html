            <span>Background</span>
            I completed my undergrad in 2018 with a BA in Earth and Planetary Sciences from Northwestern University. 
            During that time I developed a passion for learning about how the world works.  
            My first projects were simple Python, but I grew in ability and moved towards modeling. I helped develop a way to model
            the strength of gravity anomalies over a specified area given the densities of the layers of rock below the surface. Then, I
            received the opportunity to work with both hardware and software when building a light sensor for the Cave Pearl Project - diving 
            into circuits and low-level code with Arduino components powered by C++. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Now, I've taken my passion for gathering and analyzing data away from the world of rocks. I recently became a certified full stack web developer and have been lucky to work with incredibly intelligent
            people to develop apps I am proud of. Gradus for the musicians out there, Spatify as a fun proof-of-concept for those seeking some self-care,
            and Artists Fighting Isolation (AFI) for every artist trying to grow a career.

              Gradus is a MERN stack, music composition app allowing music theory students (eventually anyone who wants to make music) 
              to complete exercises with real-time rendering and support for external MIDI keyboards. 
              The app is extensible and will allow for melody generation and feedback generated by counterpoint algorithms. 
              Lighter and more user-friendly than digital audio workstations (DAWs),
               users can access all of Gradus’ features (even usb instrument support) directly through the browser.

          <p>
            Spatify is a proof-of-concept for an app similar to Groupon or Yelp but with emphasis on mutually beneficial deals.
            Empty seats in salons and spas generate zero revenue so why not offer them in a firesale format at a heavy discount?
            Consumers looking for something to do can make an immediate appointment for much less than they would pay normally. 
            This app runs using HTML, CSS with Materialize, and JavaScript on the front end. 
            The back end uses Node.js, Express, MySQL with Sequelize, Node Mailer, and later.js

          <p>
            <a href="https://thecavepearlproject.org/">The Cave Pearl Project</a>
             is a project aimed at replacing expensive commercial environmental sensors with open-source,
             microcontroller-powered, data logging platforms. My participation in this project was developing a lux (light intensity)
             sensor that could be deployed for months at a time deep in flooded caves. In addition to developing the physical build, I wrote
             the code with the goal of minimal power-usage and maximum sensitivity (in a pitch-black cave there aren't many false positives). 
             This was done in the Arduino IDE using C++. The aim was to deploy these sensors in a cave known as El Hoyo Negro, an important archeological
             site. There are multiple, supposedly secure, entrances to the cave. With these sensors, we can log the frequency and direction the trespassers
             come from based off the sensors detecting trace amounts of light given off by their diving flashlights (pitch black cave - a necessity!).

          <p>
            One of my first projects. A relatively simple Python program using NumPy MatPlotLib and Math modules to run a series of loops 
            over user-generated polygons representing rock layers (strata) in the Earth. The equations used are from Talwani et al., 1959. The effect 
            of the individual layer's density on the overall strength of the gravitational field of the area is calculated for each vertex of
            each polygon and averaged over the size of the polygon. For example, dense volcanic layers would cause an increase in gravitational force
            (only noticeable to super-sensitive instrumentation, you're not going to sink into the ground) whereas light, sedimentary layers would have the opposite effect.

            Thanks for your interest! I was fortunate enough to present my research at several conferences and even be listed
            as a co-author on an article published in GSA Today. Below you can find summaries of my 2 favorite pieces of work.

            <b>"Is the coast toast?"</b> This article offers an easy-to-understand breakdown of upper-level earthquake probability models.
            Essentially, when modeling you can have "time dependent" and "time independent" models. Time dependent means that the next earthquake 
            depends on when the previous one happened, time independent means earthquakes happen independently of each other. There is also the issue of "clustering" - 
            do earthquakes happen in clusters? Are we in a cluster right now? Using these parameters, you can drastically alter the predicted timeline.

            <br />
            <b>"Earthquakes and Moneyball."</b> This talk, presented at the Geological Society of America 2017 Fall Meeting, expands the discussion
            of predicting earthquake probabilities by using baseball metaphors as a teaching tool. Is the batter in a hot streak (cluster)? Is it better
            to look at recent performance versus long-term stats (time dependent versus independent).
             A similar version of this was presented the American Geophysical Union 2018 Winter Meeting.
